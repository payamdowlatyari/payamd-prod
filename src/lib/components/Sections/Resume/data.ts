  text: `After obtaining my B.S. in Software Engineering from UC Irvine in 2020,
  I entered the tech industry and worked at Amplify.ai for three years developing AI applications. 
  Having the opportunity to study at UCI and work in an innovative start-up environment, 
  I've improved my technical and soft skills, uncovered my passion for design, and expanded my mastery in software development in recent years. \n 
  Meanwhile, I dedicated time to learning new skills and completed a 9-month postgraduate program in full-stack web development. 
  Likewise, I gained hands-on experience with different tools, such as JS/TS-based frameworks, including React.js, 
  server-side technologies such as Node.js, automation and DevOps tools, cloud services, and SQL and NoSQL databases. `,

    summary:
      "The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past decade. To take stock of what the topics the field has studied and methods the field has used, we map and label 523 publications from ACM's library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused on studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming barriers to data collection and reflection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving barriers to tracking stages beyond collection and reflection, engaging more with domain experts, and further discussing the privacy and ethical concerns around tracked data.",
